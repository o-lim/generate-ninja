# Defines the configuration of cc wrapper
# ccache: a c/c++ compiler cache which can greatly reduce recompilation times.
# icecc, distcc: it takes compile jobs from a build and distributes them among
#                remote machines allowing a parallel build.
#
# TIPS
#
# 1) ccache
#
# Use ccache 3.2 or later to avoid clang unused argument warnings:
# https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8118
#
# To avoid -Wparentheses-equality clang warnings, at some cost in terms of
# speed, you can do:
# export CCACHE_CPP2=yes
#
# To use icecc and ccache together, set cc_wrapper = "ccache" with
# export CCACHE_PREFIX=icecc

declare_args() {
  # Set to "ccache", "icecc" or "distcc".  Probably doesn't work on windows.
  cc_wrapper = ""
}
